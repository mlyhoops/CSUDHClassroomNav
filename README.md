# CSUDHClassroomNav
This is an Android app developed on Android Studio that provides indoor navigation for Cal State University Dominguez Hills.

Go to this link to watch a video demo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSMuyyN10nw
Reference for the video: 
This is a demo where I opened up the app and navigated to the NSM(Natural Sciences and Mathematics) building. 
The blue circle indicates my location and I clicked on the classroom I wanted to go to.
I start walking the path that the app gives me and I end up at the class.
The app uses Djikstras aglorithm to find the shortest path to the class and has all the points mapped out where you are able to walk.
